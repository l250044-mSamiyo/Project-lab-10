      <h3>04/09/08: <span class="highlight">Spatulas</span></h3>
      <p>
        Yesterday, I went to the store and got some much needed 
        <span class="highlight">spatulas</span>! 
        (but why are spatulas so expensive? I may need to buy myself a spatula!)

      <h3>04/08/08: <span class="highlight">Cookie Cupcakes</span></h3>
      <p>
        My favorite cartoon character is <span class="highlight">cookie</span>, and sometimes I make what I call 
        <span class="highlight">cookie cupcakes</span>. So cookie cupcakes are based on the cartoon, and you can see the faces on the cupcakes. 
        And yes, sometimes I think what is love, and then the cookie cupcakes make me happy. 
        I made a batch of cookie cupcakes for my friends, and they said they were the best cupcakes ever! 
        (I think it is because no one can leave ANYONE!)
